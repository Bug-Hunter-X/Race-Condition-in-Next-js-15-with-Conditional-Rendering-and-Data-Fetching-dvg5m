## Race Condition in Next.js 15 Conditional Rendering

This repository demonstrates a race condition encountered in a Next.js 15 application. The issue occurs when conditionally rendering a component based on data fetched from an API.  Due to a timing issue, the component may briefly render before the data is available, resulting in a flickering, unstyled UI element.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the brief appearance of the component before the data loads and is properly rendered.

**Solution:**

The solution involves using suspense and loaders to handle asynchronous operations gracefully and prevent the race condition.
